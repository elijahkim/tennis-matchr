Tennis Match
=============

Application
---------------

Tennis Match is a web application that integrates the Elo rating system from
Chess. The app was created to have take out the arbitrary self rating system
that the USTA provides. Instead every match the user will submit the results of
the match and the app will update each player's Elo. By doing so, the user will
be able to find accurate and competitive matches.
